# Classic-Cipher-Algorithms

Classic cipher algorithms are encryption methods that have been used in history, but unlike modern crypto algorithms, they can be easily calculated. Examples of classic cipher algorithms in history can be given as algorithms such as Caesar, Sacco, Vigenere...

We can divide the classic cipher methods into two in terms of the methods it uses. These are transposition and substitution methods.

## Transposition ciphers

In Transposition Cipher, an open message that we have available is encrypted by subjecting it to some scrolling or displacement within the characters in the message. The important point in this method is that the existing characters stay the same both in the encryption and decryption stages.

##	Substitution ciphers

In substitution methods, the goal is to encrypt the text by replacing some characters or character groups with other characters. While in the transposition method only the characters in the hand can be processed, in the substitution method, all the characters in the hand can be changed and replaced with irrelevant characters, numbers and punctuation marks.
